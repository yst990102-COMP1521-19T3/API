Write a C program, <code>last_line</code>,
which takes one argument, a filename,
and which should print the last line of that file.
For example:

<pre is="tty">
<kbd is="sh">dcc last_line.c -o last_line</kbd>
<kbd is="sh">echo -e 'hello\ngood bye' &gt;hello_goodbye.txt</kbd>
<kbd is="sh">cat hello_goodbye.txt</kbd>
hello
good bye
<kbd is="sh">./last_line hello_goodbye.txt</kbd>
good bye
</pre>
<p>
You program should not assume the last byte of the file is a newline character.

<pre is="tty">
<kbd is="sh">echo -n -e 'hello\ngoodbye' &gt;no_last_newline.txt</kbd>
hello
goodbye<kbd is="sh">./last_line no_last_newline.txt</kbd>
goodbye<kbd is="sh"></kbd>
</pre>
<p>
Your program should handle extremely large files.
It should not read the entire file.
As this is a challenge exercise,
marks will not be awarded for programs which read the entire file.
<p>
For example, it should be able to print the last line of a one-terabyte file:

<pre is="tty">
<kbd is="sh">echo -e 'Hello\nGood Bye'|dd status=none seek=1T bs=1 of=/tmp/gigantic_file$$</kbd>
<kbd is="sh">ls -l /tmp/gigantic_file$$</kbd>
-rw-r--r-- 1 z5555555 z5555555 1099511627791 Oct 26 17:27 gigantic_file12345
<kbd is="sh">./last_line /tmp/gigantic_file$$</kbd>
Good Bye
</pre>
<p>
The gigantic file created above is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_file">sparse file</a>,
consisting almost entirely of zero bytes:
it uses little actual disk space,
but, to be safe, remove it when you finish the exercise.
<p>
The commands above create the sparse file in /tmp to avoid it accidentally being backed up or otherwise copied.
<p>
Sparse files can create problems
if they are accidentally copied by a program
which doesn't handle them specially â€”
and most programs don't.
<p>
BTW the <em>$$</em> in the above command is replaced by the shell process id.  This is because /tmp is shared so we'd like to use a filename that is (more or less) unique.

<p>
Assume line are separated only by the byte corresponding to <code>'\n'</code>.
<p>
Assume bytes can contain any value;
you cannot assume bytes are ASCII values.

Use <cite>fseek(3)</cite> and <cite>fgetc(3)</cite>.

<p>
If the last byte of file is not <code>'\n'</code>,
you should print all bytes after the last <code>'\n'</code> byte.
<p>
If there is no <code>'\n'</code> byte, you should print the entire file.
<p>
If the last byte of the file is <code>'\n'</code>,
you should print every byte
after the previous (second last <code>'\n'</code>) <code>'\n'</code> byte.
<p>
If there is no previous <code>'\n'</code> byte,
you should print the entire file.
