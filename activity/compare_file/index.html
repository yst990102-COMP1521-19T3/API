<p>
We need to check whether 2 files contain identical bytes
<p>
Write a C program, <code>compare_file.c</code>, which takes two arguments, both filenames.
<p>
<code>compare_file.c</code> should print one line of output.
<p>
If the two files are different  <code>compare_file.c</code> should print the location of the
first byte whether they differ.   Use the same format as the example below.
<p>
If the one file is shorter than the other but the bytes it contains
are identical to the other file, <code>compare_file.c</code> should print a message indicating this.
Use the same format as the example below.
<p>
If the 2 files contain exactly the same bytes <code>compare_file.c</code> should print a message indicating this.
Again use the same format as the example below.

<pre is="tty">
<kbd is="sh">dcc compare_file.c -o compare_file</kbd>
<kbd is="sh">echo hello world &gt;file1</kbd>
<kbd is="sh">echo hello world &gt;file2</kbd>
<kbd is="sh">./compare_file file1 file2</kbd>
Files are identical
<kbd is="sh">echo -n hello &gt;file3</kbd>
<kbd is="sh">./compare_file file1 file3</kbd>
EOF on file3
<kbd is="sh">echo help me &gt;file4</kbd>
<kbd is="sh">./compare_file file1 file4</kbd>
Files differ at byte 3
</pre>
<aside class="note">
No error checking is required.
<p>
Your program can assume it is always given the names of 2 files.
<p>
Your solution must be in C only.
<p>
You are not permitted to run external programs.  You are not permitted to use  system, popen, posix_spawn, fork or exec.
