You have been given <a href="{{activity_url}}files.cp/line_length.s"><code>line_length.s</code></a>,
a MIPS assembler program that reads a line of input and then prints 42.

<pre is="tty">
<kbd is="sh">1521 spim -f line_length.s</kbd>
Loaded: /home/cs1521/share/spim/exceptions.s
Enter a line of input: <kbd>Hello</kbd>
Line length: 42
</pre>

Add code to <code>line_length.s</code>
to make it equivalent to this C program which reads a line and prints its length:

{{ include_code("files.ln/line_length.c") }}

In other words change the code you given from printing 42 to printing the
line length

<p>
For example:

<pre is="tty">
<kbd is="sh">1521 spim -f line_length.s</kbd>
Loaded: /home/cs1521/share/spim/exceptions.s
Enter a line of input: <kbd>Hello</kbd>
Line length: 6
<kbd is="sh">1521 spim -f line_length.s</kbd>
Loaded: /home/cs1521/share/spim/exceptions.s
Enter a line of input: <kbd>i MIPS you</kbd>
Line length: 11
<kbd is="sh">1521 spim -f line_length.s</kbd>
Loaded: /home/cs1521/share/spim/exceptions.s
Enter a line of input: <kbd>good bye</kbd>
Line length: 9
</pre>
<aside class="note">
As you can see in the above examples the characters read (and counted) include the '\n' at the end of the line.
<p>
You can assume a line containing at least 1 character is always successfully read.
<p>
No error handling is necessary.
