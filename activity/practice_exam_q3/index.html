<p>
In the files for this lab,
you have been given <a href="{{activity_url}}files.cp/practice_exam_q3.s"><code>practice_exam_q3.s</code></a>,
a MIPS assembler program that
reads 2 numbers and then prints 42.
<p>
Add code to <code>practice_exam_q3.s</code>
to make it equivalent to this C program:

{{ include_code("files.ln/practice_exam_q3.c") }}

In other words it should read 2 numbers and print the numbers between them, except it doesn't print 13.
<p>
For example:

<pre is="tty">
<kbd is="sh">1521 spim -f practice_exam_q3.s</kbd>

You can assume the first number read is not greater than the second number.
