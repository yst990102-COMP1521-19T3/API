You have been given <a href="{{activity_url}}files.cp/line_char.s"><code>line_char.s</code></a>,
a MIPS assembler program that reads a line of input then reads an integer, <em>n</em>, then prints a '?'.

<pre is="tty">
<kbd is="sh">1521 spim -f line_char.s</kbd>
Loaded: /home/cs1521/share/spim/exceptions.s
Enter a line of input: <kbd>Hello</kbd>
Enter a position: <kbd>1</kbd>
Character is: ?
</pre>

Add code to <code>line_char.s</code>
to make it equivalent to this C program which reads a line and prints the character
in  position <em>n</em>:

{{ include_code("files.ln/line_char.c") }}

In other words change the code you given from printing a '?' to printing the
first character of the line that has been read.

<p>
For example:

<pre is="tty">
<kbd is="sh">1521 spim -f line_char.s</kbd>
Loaded: /home/cs1521/share/spim/exceptions.s
Enter a line of input: <kbd>abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz</kbd>
Enter a position: <kbd>0</kbd>
Character is: a
<kbd is="sh">1521 spim -f line_char.s</kbd>
Loaded: /home/cs1521/share/spim/exceptions.s
Enter a line of input: <kbd>abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz</kbd>
Enter a position: <kbd>13</kbd>
Character is: n
<kbd is="sh">1521 spim -f line_char.s</kbd>
Loaded: /home/cs1521/share/spim/exceptions.s
Enter a line of input: <kbd>Hello Andrew!</kbd>
Enter a position: <kbd>12</kbd>
Character is: !
<kbd is="sh">1521 spim -f line_char.s</kbd>
Loaded: /home/cs1521/share/spim/exceptions.s
Enter a line of input: <kbd>i MIPS you</kbd>
Enter a position: <kbd>3</kbd>
Character is: I

You can assume a line can be read.
