<p>
Your task is to simulate least-recently-used (LRU) replacement of
virtual memory pages.
<p>
Write a C program, <code>lru.c</code>, which takes two arguments, both integers.
<p>
This will be respectively the size in pages of simulated physical memory and
and  the size in pages of simulated virtual memory.
<p>
<code>lru.c</code> should then read integers from stdin until EOF.
<p>
Each integer will be the number of a virtual page being accessed.
<p>
<code>lru.c</code> should print one line of output for
indicate what action occurs with a phyical memory of the given size and LRU replacement.

In the files for this week's lab you'be been give code which implements
a suitable data structure to store information about accesses,
<p>
For each access this function is called:

{{ include_code("files.cp/lru.c", function_only='access_page') }}

You can complete the lab by adding code to this function (you are also free to write your own program).
<p>
<aside class="hint">
If you implement this in the most obvious way you can ignore the number of virtual pages.
</aside>
<aside class="note">
No error checking is required.
<p>
Your program can assume it is always given the names of 2 valid arguments.
